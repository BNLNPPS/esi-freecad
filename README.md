# ESI: FreeCAD

A repository to manage FreeCAD files useful for experimentation with detector modeling,
initially created for testing Mitsuba models.

FreeCAD can import and export a variety of formats including but note limited to
OBJ.

In addition, we manage files imported into FreeCAD from the available _STEP_ and _STL_
materials provided by the pfRICH group.
